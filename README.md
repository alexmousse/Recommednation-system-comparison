# Recommednation-system-comparison
Assignment 3/3 for Practical data science with python

The key objectives of this assignment is to learn how to compare and contrast several recommendation system algorithms. There are three major components of the assignment â€“ a completed Jupyter notebook used to run your experiments, a written report, and a short video presentation where I describe what I did and my key findings.
The dataset I used is a sample of the Netflix Prize data, prepared by the class instructor. The problem is movie recommendation, and the data is already split into a training and validation set that I use to run all of my experiments. Further information can be found within the "A3.pdf".
